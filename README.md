I got curious in checking which persons or organizations are accessing
my website. *LittleBrother* is a script for checking the IP addresses
found in Apache logs against a known database of IP networks or single
addresses.

Please see [my personal blog for more information](http://bastian.rieck.ru/blog/posts/2015/little_brother_website_analysis).
